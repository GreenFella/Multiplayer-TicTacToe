notes:
-svg grid is 700 x 700
-winningCombinations = [123, 456, 789, 147, 258, 369, 159, 357]
-233 width each square and 233 height each square
-210px seperating each x/y point for the x's

bugs/to add:
-can place a nought/cross while game status is waiting for opponent (FIXED)


-no finished screen on a draw (FIXED)


-cant tell if other player has left the match (FIXED) seems to be buggy? cant reproduce errors??


-can be player two even if there is no player one making you just wait for player1 to do something
IDEAS if you get player two and it detects there is not opponent using a new function that tics every 250 ms it will go to a new session and do the check again (if you get player 2 again) until a player is found (FIXED)

-game draws when all squares are filled and the last square someone wins.. it still says draw

-TO ADD - no time limit on turn (easy)
-TO ADD - custom player name (easy)
-TO ADD - a way to make a custom game, to play against a friend (medium)
-TO ADD - a way to play against AI (hard)
